CN-Clustering-Algorithm
=======================

JS implementation of a non-classified point clustering algorithm I wrote. See cn_clustering.js

This algorithm runs asymptotically in O(n) time, which is significantly faster than the normal K-means clustering, which is NP-Hard.


Example implementation, clustering RGB values to find the dominant color range in an image:
